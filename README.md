# image-similarity-deep-learning
With the rapid growth of image data, traditional pixel-based comparison fails to capture semantic similarity. This project leverages deep learning embeddings to represent images meaningfully, enabling efficient and robust image similarity search applicable to retrieval systems, e-commerce, medical imaging, and visual analytics.
